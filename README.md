# github-issues-import-api-tools

This repo gathers a python3 script [json2github.py](./json2github.py),
which has been developed by reusing code from the following tools:

- [bugzilla2github](https://gist.github.com/Zimmi48/d923e52f64fe17c72852d9c148bfcdc6) by [Th√©o Zimmermann](https://github.com/Zimmi48/)
- [github2github](https://github.com/semihalf-berestovskyy-andriy/tools/blob/master/github2github) by [Andriy Berestovskyy](https://github.com/semihalf-berestovskyy-andriy/)

It relies on the new [GitHub Import API](https://gist.github.com/jonmagic/5282384165e0f86ef105).
